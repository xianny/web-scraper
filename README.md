This is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) web scraper. To run, download the project and run the following commands from the project directory:

    $ bundle install
    $ ruby web_scraper.rb post.html

I made this scraper early in the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp to practice using the Nokogiri gem.
